## Introduction

The sinking of the Titanic in 1912 is one of the most infamous maritime disasters in history. The dataset provides a snapshot of the passengers' demographics, ticket information, and whether they survived or not. Through rigorous data exploration and machine learning techniques, we aim to gain insights into the factors that influenced survival rates.

## What You'll Find
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** We meticulously examine the dataset, looking at features such as age, gender, class, and embarkation point to uncover patterns and correlations. Visualizations and summary statistics will be employed to provide a clear understanding of the data.

* **Machine Learning Models:** Building on the insights gained from the EDA, we implement and evaluate several machine learning models. These models will be trained on a portion of the data and tested on another to assess their predictive accuracy.
